package types

// Standard Kubernetes condition types used across OADP VM File Restore CRDs.
// These follow Kubernetes API conventions and are the primary source of truth for resource state.
// Both VirtualMachineBackupsDiscovery and VirtualMachineFileRestore use these identical condition types.
const (
	// ConditionTypeProgressing indicates whether an operation is actively running.
	// Status=True: Operation is in progress (Phase: InProgress)
	// Status=False: Operation is not running (Phase: New, Completed, PartiallyFailed, Failed, Deleting)
	//
	// Common reasons for VirtualMachineBackupsDiscovery:
	//   - "DiscoveryStarted", "ScanningBackups", "DiscoveryCompleted", "DiscoveryFailed"
	//
	// Common reasons for VirtualMachineFileRestore:
	//   - "Validating", "CreatingRestores", "WaitingForRestores", "SettingUpFileServing",
	//     "RestoreCompleted", "ValidationFailed"
	ConditionTypeProgressing = "Progressing"

	// ConditionTypeAvailable indicates whether a resource has usable data/functionality.
	// Status=True: Resource is usable (Phase: Completed or PartiallyFailed)
	// Status=False: Resource is not usable (Phase: New, InProgress, Failed, Deleting)
	//
	// For VirtualMachineBackupsDiscovery:
	//   - Available=True means "at least one valid backup was found"
	//   - Available=False means "no valid backups found yet" or "discovery failed"
	//
	// For VirtualMachineFileRestore:
	//   - Available=True means "files are accessible via file serving resources"
	//   - Available=False means "files not yet available" or "all restores failed"
	//
	// Common reasons:
	//   - "ValidBackupsFound", "FileServingReady" (when True)
	//   - "InProgress", "WaitingForRestores", "Failed", "NoValidBackupsFound" (when False)
	//
	// KEY DISTINCTION:
	//   - PartiallyFailed phase → Available=True (some data is usable)
	//   - Failed phase → Available=False (nothing usable)
	ConditionTypeAvailable = "Available"

	// ConditionTypeDegraded indicates partial failures or suboptimal conditions occurred.
	// Status=True: Some operations failed (Phase: PartiallyFailed or Failed)
	// Status=False: All operations succeeded (Phase: Completed)
	//
	// IMPORTANT: Degraded=True does NOT always mean unusable!
	//
	// When Available=True AND Degraded=True (Phase: PartiallyFailed):
	//   - Resource is FUNCTIONAL and USABLE
	//   - Some operations failed, but others succeeded
	//   - Users should investigate but can still use the resource
	//
	// Example scenarios:
	//   - VirtualMachineBackupsDiscovery: Found 3 valid backups, but 2 failed to scan
	//   - VirtualMachineFileRestore: 2 of 3 Velero Restores succeeded
	//
	// Common reasons:
	//   - "PartialFailure", "SomeBackupsInvalid", "SomeRestoresFailed" (when True)
	//   - "AllOperationsSucceeded", "NoFailures", "AllBackupsValid", "AllRestoresSucceeded" (when False)
	ConditionTypeDegraded = "Degraded"

	// ConditionTypeReady is a summary condition indicating overall usability.
	// Status=True: Resource is usable for its purpose (Phase: Completed or PartiallyFailed)
	// Status=False: Resource is not usable yet or failed (Phase: New, InProgress, Failed, Deleting)
	//
	// Calculation: Ready = Available (True if resource has usable data)
	//
	// This means:
	//   - Ready=True for Phase Completed (perfect, no issues)
	//   - Ready=True for Phase PartiallyFailed (degraded but usable)
	//   - Ready=False for Phase Failed (not usable)
	//
	// Common reasons:
	//   - "DiscoveryComplete", "RestoreComplete" (when True)
	//   - "InProgress", "Failed", "Deleting" (when False)
	//
	// Use Case: Simple readiness check for automation
	ConditionTypeReady = "Ready"
